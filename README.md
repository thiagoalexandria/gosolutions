## 1. Project

  Go solutions is a project that emerged based on the discipline "Electronic Commerce" of the university where we had to make a project using the concepts of mental triggers and perceived risks, to increase the engagement of the subscriber or visitor of the site. Our choice was to start from a technology company, being a growing market, our company is a specialist in network monitoring, using zabbix, the company uses the solution planning device for small, medium and large companies.
  
  
## 2. Prceived risks

  In this project, we explore some perceived risks, bad before we begin, we need to understand what a perceived risk is.
  
  A perceived risk is the uncertainty that the individual experiences about the consequences of a decision made. Consumers, when buying a new product (for them or in the market), fear that it will not meet their needs as they expect.
  

### Now, we'll explain a bit about the types of risk exploited to build our site:
  #### Financial Risk: 
   Refers to a result that financially compromises the consumer, that is, a certain purchase that leaves him financially ill.
  #### Functional or Performance Risk: 
   Refers to how well a product performs its required technical functions.
  #### Social Risk: 
  Relative to the perception that the consumer has of the way other people will react to their purchase.
  #### Psychological Risk: 
  Refers to the way the consumer perceives himself after making a purchase, in terms of his self-image or self-concept.
  #### Time Risk: 
  Refers to the loss that occurs when a product fails and needs to be repaired or replaced by another.
  #### Risk of Lost Opportunity Cost: 
  Relative to the expectation that a better or lower cost product may be available in the future.
  #### Physical Hazards: 
  Relative to any damage that the product may suffer.
  #### Risks of Satisfaction: 
  Relating to expectations, satisfaction (Consumer Rights / Repentance)
  
## 3. Mental Triggers

  One of the most important is to use the mental triggers to attract more visitors, some customers. A mental trigger is a function or some artifices that we can use to persuade our potential client in order to secure a sale or business.
We explore and adjust some of these triggers to our need in order to shape our business reality.

  We use the book by Robert Cialdini, as rich as that.

  Mental triggers are the decisions our brain makes on autopilot to avoid our exhaustion in the face of so many choices.

  It is as if he filters out which decisions really need special attention and, with the others, he simply performs what he has already been "educated" to do.
  
  #### Reciprocity: Kindness generates kindness

  The trigger of reciprocity is one of the most important and is also the basis of inbound marketing. This is because we have a natural tendency to want to give back to that or that which gives us value in some way.

  But of course we need to see this act as something spontaneous, made from the heart. That is why your actions should first aim at making people's lives simpler and then generating some profit for you. Not the other way around. People feel this.
  
  ### Commitment and Coherence:

  Consistency is highly valued in our culture even in situations where this is not the most sensible path. The agreement between what is said and what is done is something well-regarded by society and is generally related to a person's maturity and psychic balance.

  Robert Cialdini addresses this issue in his "Weapons of Persuasion". In it, he explains that, in addition to social acceptance, coherence also serves as a shortcut to the brain.

  When one is coherent, it is enough to recall past actions to facilitate decision making. By using what we have already done as a basis, we avoid pondering every circumstance to make a new decision.
  
  ### Social Proof: Tell me who you are ...

  Jean-Paul Sartre already said: "The other is our best mirror". Yes, we are social beings and many of our attitudes are based on what other people expect of us.

  In addition, we need to belong to groups that identify us as individuals, in this way, social proof is a very powerful trigger.

  See an example of daily life. If you had to choose between two restaurants: one much more full, with a waiting line, or the one on the side, totally empty ... Which would you choose? As much as people do not like to wait, they prefer not to be disappointed. Soon, we think: if the restaurant is full it is because it is good.
  
  ### Affection:

  As we have just seen, it is much easier to follow an advice about a product coming from people who have already consumed it. This power multiplies when it comes from someone in our family, for example. This is because people are more likely to say yes to those who know, admire or have affection.

  Another factor that triggers the trigger of affection is physical attractiveness. Attractive people have greater power of persuasion and, according to Cialdini, research shows that it overlaps even gentleness and intelligence.
  
  ### Authority:

  This is a very peculiar trigger because while it is very effective it can also be harmful if used for evil.

  There was a great experiment by Stanley Milgrim in the 1960s, in which people were willing to punish other participants on the orders of an authority (a teacher).
  
  Whenever one of the participants (an actor) erases a question, the other member of the study (ordinary person) should give him a shock. The shocks were a lie, but the actor pretended to be feeling more and more pain, crying and screaming.

  Even though they were uncomfortable with the situation, the invited participants complied with what was commanded because the human being tends to obey whom he judges to be superior, out of respect.

  So if you want people to trust you and your job, you need to position yourself as an authority in the niche you serve.
  
  ### Shortage:

  Do you prefer to get a discount of $ 5.00 or avoid an additional payment of $ 5.00? If you're like most people, you'd rather avoid an additional $ 5.00 payment ... But would getting a $ 5 discount would not have the same result? Yes! Although in both situations you save $ 5.00, at first you have a positive feeling (gain a discount), while in the second a negative feeling (avoid additional payment).
